# Portfolio Project: CS 101

### Project Parameters
The **goal** of this project is to build a basic terminal program for my friends and family to play with. After I've finished building the program, I will blog about it on my medium of choice. Below are the main project objectives

- Build a terminal program using Python
- Add at least one interactive feature using input()
- Use Git version control
- Use the command line and file navigation
- Write a technical blog post on the project

### Project Brainstorming
I've thought up several ideas for what could be useful and fun to play with in a basic terminal program. The ideas divide into two basic categories: games and tools. The games would be the most fun to play, and probably a bit more involved than the tools, so I've decided to pick one of the games that is maybe one of the more complicated ones -- Texas Hold 'Em. 

#### Games
- Blackjack
- Texas Hold 'Em
- Roulette
  
#### Tools
- Mortgage Calculator
- Payback Period Calculator
- Simple Stock DCF Modeler
- Fortune Teller
- Quotation of the Day (mood-based)
